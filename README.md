# TributeTask
A small task for School of code where i had to build a tribute page from the ground up using HTML5 and CSS3. This is also a freecodecamp task.
My daughter is home from school for the summer holidays and wanted to help me with this task. She chose the topic and helped to pick out the images.
Its a little cringe but she had a great time with the task and she was very happy with the end result!
